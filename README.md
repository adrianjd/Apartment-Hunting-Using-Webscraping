# Apartment-Hunting-Using-Webscraping (Currently WIP)

This repository uses Python to webscrape a few popular property sites and then store them in Excel.

apartment_listings.py is the program file. It uses the BeautifulSoup library (bs4) to scrape data from three specific websites: realtor.com, redfin.com, and zillow.com.
