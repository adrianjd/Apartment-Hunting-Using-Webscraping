# Apartment-Hunting-Using-Webscraping 
This repository uses Python to webscrape a few popular property sites and then store them in Excel.
Apartment locations are all in, or near, Belleville, New Jersey.

apartment_listings.py is the program file. It uses the BeautifulSoup library (bs4) to scrape data from three specific websites: realtor.com, redfin.com, and zillow.com.

An example output file is provided to show what the final outcome should look like. Additional data rearrangement(s) can be done in Excel/LibreOffice/etc.
